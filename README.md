Virtual Birthday Card Board 💌
Objective: Create a web application that allows users to contribute to a collective birthday message board by creating personalized virtual birthday cards.
Features:
User Input Form:
Implement a form using DOM manipulation for users to input their name, a personal message, and a URL for an image or GIF.
Apply form validation to ensure all fields are populated and the image/GIF URL is valid.
Dynamic Card Display:
Upon submission, dynamically generate a “card” within a grid on the board that displays the entered name, message, and image/GIF.
Style cards with CSS to ensure an attractive and uniform.
Card Moderation:
Provide a “Delete” button on each card that allows for its removal from the board when clicked.
Include a “Feature” button that, upon clicking, highlights the card by enhancing the font of the text and changing the border to a golden color to signify its importance.
Implementation Details:
Event listeners should be attached to the “Delete” and “Feature” buttons during the card’s creation phase to handle click events.
The “Feature” button could toggle a CSS class that applies the highlighting effect to the card.
Note: Without local storage, the board will reset with each page refresh.
